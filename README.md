# Project
Very raw HTML form with basic Javascript. The beginning piece of a considerably larger project/vision.
Focusing on the server-side programming, portal login, and database design layout.  Will return to this.

Needs: 
CSS formatting// 
Possibly superior method of Javascript restricting selections?// 
Fine-tuning of the HTML form

Overview of the HTML/JS
A form that has 14 selectable options, but you can only select 9.  (The amount of 9 will never change, but the 14 might)

Preferably while only being able to select 1 option per game 
(This detail is why you see so many commented out scripts. I was able to restrict 1 per game, but it overwrote the overall 9 selection...)

The selected options will be sent & stored in a MYSQL database, and matched against the correct answers.
