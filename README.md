# Project

Very raw HTML form with basic Javascript.   The beginning piece of a considerably larger project/vision.  
Focusing on the server-side programming & database design layout, will return to this.

Needs:
CSS formatting,
Possibly superior method of Javascript restricting selections?, and
Fine-tuning of the HTML form


HTML/JS
Create a form that has 14 selectable options, but you can only select 9.
The selected options will be stored in a MYSQL database, and matched against the correct answers.
